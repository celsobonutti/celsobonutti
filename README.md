### Hello there, I'm [Celso](https://cel.so)! üëΩ

I'm always trying something new, specially new languages ;)

Right now working on a [chip8 emulator](https://github.com/celsobonutti/xipe-oito) with both WASM and native desktop support, using the incredible [iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced) library.
Also learning oCaml to do create some things with Reason Native, since it's my favorite language for web development.

You can reach me on [telegram](https://t.me/robertinhobaptista) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/celsobonutti).

### Funcional Salvador üÖ∞Ô∏è ‚û°Ô∏è üÖ±Ô∏è
I'm one of the maintainers of [funcional-ssa](https://github.com/funcional-ssa/), an organization devoted to spreading the word about functional programming languages in Salvador, Bahia.
We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/6VG5wsS) and a [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/CdUFVRT_8ZNnV3Bu8IHrvQ), and do coding dojos every two weeks. If you have interest, please come by and say hi!
