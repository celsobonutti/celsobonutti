#### Hello there, I'm [Celso](https://cel.so)! üëΩ

I'm a developer from Salvador, Bahia.
I work (remotely) at [Ingenious](https://www.ingenious.agency/), a software company from Uruguay. Sometimes I also do some freelancing for [e-rural](https://erural.net).

Lately I've been playing a lot with Elixir (Phoenix and LiveView), Elm and ReasonML ([sometimes all of them](https://github.com/celsobonutti/elm-webrtc/)), besides some Rust when I wanna do something different.

I really like to learn new things so, if you have something interesting, please share! You can reach me on [Telegram](https://t.me/robertinhobaptista) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/celsobonutti).

#### Funcional Salvador üÖ∞Ô∏è ‚û°Ô∏è üÖ±Ô∏è
I'm one of the maintainers of [funcional-ssa](https://github.com/funcional-ssa/), an organization devoted to spreading the word about functional programming languages in Salvador, Bahia.
We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VuQKCZ) and a [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/CdUFVRT_8ZNnV3Bu8IHrvQ), and do coding dojos every two weeks. If you have interest, please come by and say hi!
